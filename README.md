# Microarray---Cross-platform-Normalization

Cross-platform normalization (also termed “data merging”) considers all data from experiments across 
different microarray platforms as a single data set from the same experiment. Direct integration of 
data sets performed on different microarray platforms may introduce undesirable batch effects due to
systematic multiplicative biases. The level of difficulty present to combine multiple datasets has been 
termed “dataset complexity”. For example, integrating different Affymetrix platforms is less complex to 
analyze by meta-analysis or cross platform normalization than datasets performed across very different platforms. 
Studies using low complexity datasets, mainly from the Affymetrix platform, have directly merged the studies to 
construct a gene signature.

Cross-platform transformation and normalization methods have been developed with an aim to remove the artifactual 
differences between data from different microarray platforms while preserving the underlying biological differences 
between conditions. This step is essential, as non-biological differences (“batch effects”) in the gene signature 
discovery data can obscure real biological differences found between clinical groups.
